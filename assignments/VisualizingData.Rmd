```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

#Haploid selection model
p= frequency of the p allele
Fitness of big A and Fitness of little a
Function that takes these three variable and gives you a new p value for the next generation
```{r}
NextGen= function(p, WA, Wa){
  
  p = (p*WA)/((p*WA)+((1-p)*Wa))
}
```
How do we check that is deterministic versus stochastic? Basically use lapply and do this over and over and over again
```{r}
p = c(0.01,1.1,1)
myWrapper = function(p,runs =200){
  finalp = numeric(runs)
  finalp[1]= p[1]
  for (i in 2:runs){
    p[1] = NextGen(p[1], p[2],p[3])
    finalp[i] = p[1]
  }
  return(finalp)
}
end = myWrapper(p,100)

```
